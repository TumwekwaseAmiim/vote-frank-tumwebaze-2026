    <h2>Achievements in Kibale East</h2>
    <p>
      Hon. Frank Tumwebaze has consistently worked to uplift all 9 subcounties of Kibale East — including Bihanga, Lyakahungu, Nkoma, Nkoma-Katalyeba, Bwizi, Ntonwa, Biguli Subcounty, Biguli Town Council, and Kabuye.
      Under his leadership, communities have seen tangible progress in education, health, infrastructure, community development, and access to water and electricity. While not every single intervention can be listed here, his impact is felt in every corner of the constituency.
      From constructing classrooms and health centers, to supporting local churches, mosques, and youth groups, Frank’s work reflects dedication and deep understanding of local needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the election approaches on <strong>January 15, 2026</strong>, it is crucial to choose leadership with proven experience and strong roots in the community. Many of those standing against him are newcomers seeking political gains. They lack a track record of service and do not possess the knowledge or leadership experience that Frank brings. Voting for Hon. Frank ensures continuity, accountability, and development that truly benefits the people of Kibale East.
